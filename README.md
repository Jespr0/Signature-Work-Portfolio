### Relational Database for Microbialites
During CISC 450 Database Deisgn there was a group project to develop a relational databse for Dr. Hickson,
a professor of geology at the University of St. Thomas. Hickson is leading a study in Nevada to look
for many types of rocks containing a small sediment deposit known as a Microbialite. These rock formations
in Nevada have similar conditions to rocks being collected on Mars and will be compared later in a study to
see if Microbes and by extension life have occured on Mars. Hickson came to us with a very disorganized 
database with a complex set of foreign key constraints and asked if we could clean it up. Using an SQL 
database as well as a Python Command Line Interface we were able to create a database that was abled to
be easily accessed by all users and modified without violating constraints by Admins.
