# Work Portfolio

### Relational Database for Microbialites:
During CISC 450 Database Deisgn there was a group project to develop a relational databse for Dr. Hickson,
a professor of geology at the University of St. Thomas. Hickson is leading a study in Nevada to look
for many types of rocks containing a small sediment deposit known as a Microbialite. These rock formations
in Nevada had similar environmental conditions to rocks being collected on Mars and will be compared later in a study to
see if Microbes and by extension life have occured on Mars. Dr. Hickson came to us with a very complex 
database with many foreign key constraints and asked if we could clean it up. Using an SQL 
database as well as a Python Command Line Interface we were able to create a database that was able to
be easily accessed by all users and modified by Admins. Future plans for this project are to develop it into
a web application so that more people can have access to it.

### Personal Website:
In CISC 375 Web Design we were tasked with using the Foundation CSS framework, HTML, and Javascript to create
a Dynamic website that adjusts based on the browser size. Foundation CSS is great for this as it is able to 
dynamically change the size and location of HTML Elements through its XY Grid System. While Foundation can be used
in a seperate CSS file; It's main functionality is through creating a Grid Element in your HTML file, and using foundation
to adjust elements with in line CSS.

### Crime Map and Restful Server:
Another project from Web Design was creating a custom Single Page Application using Node.js, Vue.js, Foundation CSS, and the Leaftlet API. 
Using data from the St. Paul Police Department and NodeJs to host the databse on a localhost server we created an application that was able
to search for previously filed crimes in the City of St. Paul. The user is also able to query the database for certain types of crimes in areas or 
add crimes through the text fields on the application. We used Foundation CSS to improve the design of the application.
